    <h3 class="text-center text-main border-bottom mb-3">Quick Setup Guide To Colibri for Profesionals</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Create a Profile:</strong> Your profile is how potential clients will contact you. Email, phone number,
        website and address are
        a must. Share where you can from and what design you specialize in. Your profile gives one of the first
        impressions
        prospective clients will have of you and your business. It also acts as an online billboard, portfolio and
        resume all in
        one.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Profile Photo:</strong>
        Your profile photo on Houzz is an important visual representation of your company’s brand and using
        your photo, instead of a logo or graphic, helps potential clients connect with you on a more personal level.
        People
        want to connect with people. They want to picture who they are calling on the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Upload a Portfolio:</strong>
        This is where you show off your work. Upload high-resolution images which are at least 1000
        pixels wide. Once images are uploaded you can edit and organize them into projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Create Tags:</strong>
        Tags not only identify what is in the photo but help people find the photo. A tag could be ‘nursery table’,
        but should also be ‘Atlanta’, ‘boys room’ and ‘vintage nursery’ in order to get the best response.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Bolster Your Reputation:</strong>
        The more reviews you have, the more potential customers can read and learn about the
        way you work with clients and complete projects. Recent reviews paint a picture of happy clients and an active
        business.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do Your Research:</strong>
        Doing a quick competitive analysis can help give you direction for building and shaping your
        profile:
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the Directory to look up competitors’ services offered, styles, and typical job costs. If you see a lack of
        a service
        being offered, you could meet a need and find a niche. Compare your number of reviews, affiliations, and length
        of
        business description to the top pros in your area, and use that as a benchmark to develop your own profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Update Projects Frequently:</strong>
        Give potential clients an idea of what you can do by showing off your projects on your
        profile. Posting new photos every time you complete a project will remind homeowners that you’re an active
        professional and constantly working on new projects. More photos also makes you look like you’re in high demand,
        allows you to show off different types of work you can do. Adding locations to your projects can reinforce that
        you
        are the go-to pro in a particular city or neighborhood.
